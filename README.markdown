# Geany on Rails

Package contains:

* Ruby and Ruby on Rails snippets, mainly borrowed from TextMate
  Ruby on Rails bundle.
* Railscast TextMate theme (created by Ryan Bytes), converted
  into Geany format.

## Installation

By default Geany stores configuration files under `~/.config/geany`.
All you have to do is just merging the `geany` directory, which
can be done as follows:

    cp -r geany-on-rails/geany ~/.config
